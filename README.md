Second attempt at Medium's CMS Editor.  After doing some research I found out about contentedible. This
allowed me to build a WYSIWYG editor that Medium has.  So I looked up a simple app that was using a
contentedible HTML element.  When I found one, I tweaked it and got to something pretty close to it.  Right now,
the app isn't structured properly.  In the future, I do intend to refactor the code into a "standard" reactjs
file structure.


## Installation
Download the zip, unzip, then on terminal cd into root directory and run the following commands to get it up and running. Nothing too complicated.
OS X & Linux:

```sh
$ npm install
# this will install the node modules
$ npm start
# this will start dev server at port 3000.
```

## Usage example

I don't think screenshots will do justice to see how the app works.  So I recorded a [demo][https://youtu.be/FW214WbsseQ] of me interacting with the site.

## Release History


* 0.0.1
    * [Here](https://github.com/jzapata87/CMSv1) is my first iteration of the editor.  It is quite different.
